OpenEmbedded-openxt
=================
This repo is a clone of the OpenEmbedded-Core repo with git submodules added
for repos needed for openxt. Slowly each openxt component will be merged into
it and the build will be fixed.


OpenEmbedded-Core is a layer containing the core metadata for current versions
of OpenEmbedded. It is distro-less (can build a functional image with
DISTRO = "nodistro") and contains only emulated machine support.

For information about OpenEmbedded, see the OpenEmbedded website:

The Yocto Project has extensive documentation about OE including a reference manual
which can be found at:
